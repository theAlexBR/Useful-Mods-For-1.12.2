| [Multithreaded Noise](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/multithreaded-noise) | None | This mod makes overworld terrain generate faster by replacing the three 3D noise generators in the overworld with multithreaded versions. This results in slightly different terrain per seed, but reduces generation time. Reduction on my 4 core system is approximately 5ms or 12% per chunk, and should be higher on systems with more available cores. | bloodnbonesgaming | Both |
